Introduction and Information Problem

	At the University of Maryland, there are a very large number of classes and professors.
    This is difficult for students because they have a hard time deciding which classes to take.
    This also is difficult for university management because they have a hard time looking at all of the information for each class. 
    There is already PlanetTerp, a website that does offer in the average grades for the courses taught by professors. 
    But PlanetTerpâ€™s architecture is limited in its display of information and could use some renovation to better serve students. 
    To summarize, the information problem we are aiming to solve is the representation of classes
    and professor information as well as the absence of some information that would benefit students when they register for classes.
    We are hoping to use the PlanetTerp grade data API (https://api.planetterp.com/?javascript#planetterp-api) to retrieve the course and professor data 
    and incorporate into a new revamped site with some newly added search features building on top of what PlanetTerp already has to offer. 
    We will implement a search feature that searches for either a course and the professors that
    teach it or a professor and the courses taught by that professor. 
    Users also will be able to filter the general list of courses by department, credits, and professors. 
    The strongest feature of concern, Average Grade, can be viewed and visualized from all the previously mentioned searches and filters.
    The Average grade can also be filtered to represent all semesters or solely the semesters from the previous academic calendar year. 
    We hope that in the end, our service will benefit students that are looking for classes to take
    and faculty that want easier access to information about university classes.
