    Information problem you're trying to solve:
        Our information problem will be presented as an issue of organization. 
        The needed information is available to students but the display and organization of the data is not in form best suited to immediately answer the entire scope of possible student concerns when registering for classes.
        What our solution aims to do is have all the PlanetTerp API data searchable and filterable in an easy to navigate and meaningful way that eases the student registration process.

    Identified stakeholders/target browsers:
        Students, faculty, and new incoming students to the University of Maryland

    Data you chose to work with:
        Professor and Course Information from PlanetTerp

    Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem:
        We will implement a search feature that searches for either a course and the professors that teach it or a professor and the courses taught by that professor. Users also will be able to filter the general list of courses by department, credits, and professors. The strongest feature of concern, Average Grade, can be viewed and visualized from all the previously mentioned searches and filters. The Average grade can also be filtered to represent all semesters or solely the semesters from the previous academic calendar year.


    Technical system decision rationale (What technical system decision can we list here?):
        -We decided to seperate the course search and the professor search on the backend
            -Doing this allowed the return searches to be less dense when returned.
            -This also lead to a better front end look when users wanted to search as well

    How/if your final system helps to address the problem:
        We address the problem by providing our stakeholders with a website where they can get all the course, grade, and professor informaiton they need. We provide them with the choice of filtering through searches. A major feature that wasn't included in the existing solution
