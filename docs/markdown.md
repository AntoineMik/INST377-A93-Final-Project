    Information problem you're trying to solve:
        Our information problem will be presented as an issue of organization. 
        The needed information is available to students but the display and organization of the data is not in form best suited to immediately answer the entire scope of possible student concerns when registering for classes.
        What our solution aims to do is have all the PlanetTerp API data searchable and filterable in an easy to navigate and meaningful way that eases the student registration process.
